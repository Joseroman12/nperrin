# Hi, I'm Norman Perrin
An argentinian software developer and sometimes teacher.
Born in 1994, interested in making quality work and help others.

# How my life is
Now I'm working fulltime for a promising startup, while sharing what I know. Also giving some talks from time to time.
Looking with interest at going to Europe (I'm french too), and learning some non tech skill... haven't decided which one yet.
Focus on having good habits to perform well.

# What's my motivation?
I find programming very fun, and frustrating when things don't work well.
That's why I'm motivated to build nice, trustable, and simple systems for the end users.
More important than fancy animations or bloated designs is that the system actually work and resolve some problem.
