Hello, my name is Norman Perrin.

I live on Argentina, French, develop software and sometimes teach programming.
Interested in making quality work and help others.


Now I'm working as a freelance, while sharing what I'm learning. Giving some talks from time to time.
Looking with interest at going to Europe, and learning some non tech skill... maybe piano but I hear suggestions.

## Motivation

I find programming fun, and frustrating when things don't work well.
That's where the motivation comes to build quality, trustable, and simple systems for the end users.
Complex systems drives downs maintanibility and my happiness, that's why I always try to make simple systems, removing as much complexity and things that could go wrong, and having the most control on the variables which I work with.

Am I crazy for wanting the served source code (`view-source:https://nperrin.io/about`) to look nice? I like the idea of people copying code of something they like and make it own, and for that the source code should be easy to read and modify.
