The [nperrin.io](https://nperrin.io) website is served statically from Netlify, is not logging any data, is not using any scripts/applications for tracking its visitors, does not place any cookies on your computer.

Netlify, on the other hand, might (read will) save server logs on their infrastructure, therefore, you should check out [Netlify’s privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy). If you’re ok with that, feel free to browse around.

## Data Transfer

All data is served over the HTTPS protocol, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider will still be able to see that you are downloading data from nperrin.io, but they will not be able to see the content.

## Do Not Track

This site uses the LetsEncrypt Certificate Authority, which is itself DNT-compliant and does not log your browser checking the validity of this site’s HTTPS certificate.
