description: Habits that I'm starting on september
---

I'm king of down with good habits. So today I've planned how could I start this month.

On eating, I'll start with a 36hr fast now (sunday night), then I'd continue as normal doing fasting at morning some days of the week. Could be something complicated tomorrow, as yesterday and today I eat a lot of carbs, knowing how this would continue.

This is what I've thought.

## Eating

- Keto, every day.
- IF, 3 times per week, but I'll see hwo I go.
- No more than 1 coffee per day.

## Exercise

- 4 to 6 times per week.
- yoga at night, 5 times per week.

## Sleep

- 7hs to 9hs per day.
- No more late than 23hs.

## Internet

- No twitter.
- Download youtube videos to see later.
- Whatsapp on lunch and after work.
- Do not open Whatsapp with less than an hour of time in between, unless I have some conversation going on.
- Email 1 time on morning and 1 time on the afternoon.
- Slack every 30' after lunch.

## General

- Meditate 10' per day.
- Read or write 30' per day, 5 times per week, no work related.
- Make my bed (not so silly when I work on my room).
- Plan the next day.

I'll log the following habits on a notebook, but maybe I'll move that to the web later.
