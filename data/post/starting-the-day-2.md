description: First day of september for me, and some thoughts on the habit of eating
---

Advancing with what [I wrote the 1st](https://nperrin.io/post/september), this morning someone made me remember something I wasn't considering, that I forgot that it happened, related to eating well (what well means to you), and diets.

Follow a diet could be hard in itself, but there's something very... annoying, which it makes that even harder, and its to explain or justify yourself. Which could look reasonable to do, even one could thought that the person asking is worried, but when you have to repeat the explanation and is not just for 1 familiar, but a bunch of people, that only what you to stop talking so they can tell you how to eat, then is... annoying.

First...

## I dunno

Not a nutritionist and don't know much about the subject, I listen to other people, doctors, athletes or celebrities, and if it hears reasonable I follow their advice, I try with me and see how I feel, you could be different, dunno.

_And why do you do something that your not sure of?_

Every time I do stuff that I'm not sure of, and for this area, with professionals and studies that contradict each other, doing the "normal", if there is a normal, I wouldn't be sure either.

## Maybe I knew

When I take a decision, I probably investigated a little bit to arrive to that conclusion. Then, I might forget, as I don't work of that, and so I'd have to trust my good judgment to be consistent on something, and go ~~reactively~~ proactively challenging what I think is right.

So, if anyone asks me: _And why you don't eat at morning? breakfast is the most important meal of the day._

Mi answer would be: _Google intermediate fasting and ketogenic diet, you'll get a better explanation._

If someone affirms: _You can't train without having eaten._

Mi answer would be: _Google intermediate fasting and ketogenic diet, you'll get a better explanation._

If another guy... you get it.

## Things that yes

I'll respect a nutritionist more than a random guys opinion, although in the area there is a lot of imprecision.

In that I admit suggestions that points to different studies of punctual things that criticize what I do. That I appreciate it.

Things that I know don't do me bad, for my own and others experience, like working out on fast, I treat related opinions without interest.

And how can you know what I may be interested in? First, look what I'm doing and how I'm going, then you'll probably have a better idea of what to ask.

I'm just bother by the lack of humility, people who thinks they own the truth, and that they don't want to listen to you, just give their opinion of something.

## The word diet

Another thing that is annoying, is that the word **diet** is associated with weight lost in a fixed time.

Originally this text was written on spanish, and surprisingly I don't find the same definition of diet, but that word in spanish «dieta», are very  similar, so I guess they come from the same origin. So I'll translate the spanish definition.

Etymology[^diet]:

> Etymologically the word «diet» comes from the greek dayta, which means 'life regime'. It's accepted as the synonym of nutritional regime, that alludes to the 'set and quantities of food or food mixtures that are consumed habitually'. Also may reference to the regime that, in determined circumstances, do healthy persons, sick or convalescent in eating, drink and sleep.

The definition is bigger than the common meaning.

More important than fat lost, I want to stay healthy, for more than 1 month. That's why diet for me is a alimentary habit, whose objectives are meanly of health.

Before comments like: _You're slim, it's not necessary for you to follow a diet._

My answer will be: _I'm don't do it for fat lost._

Before other comment like: _But you're good on health._

My answer will be: _And like that I want to stay..._

## Closing

When I wrote this yesterday on spanish, I started on the morning and finish the last part at night. And at night I remember one thing that I loooove about dieting.

I wanted to start with a 36hs fast, and I forgot that when you break a fast, things taste much better. I had my breaking fast lunch a few hours ago, and it was veery nice, a little of eggs and beacon (not to much when breaking a fast, ok I'm explaining myself again...).

Anyway, all of this can be summarize to: know your imprecision, don't annoy me... or in spanish don't rompas las bolas me.

I hope you enjoy your foods and have a healthy life.
