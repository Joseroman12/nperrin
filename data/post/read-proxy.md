My reflections and thoughts that I had in some period.

I can change my mind within a month, so don't expect this entries to not contradict each other, or me to have the same ideas as before.

Some entries are very cringy for me, but even with that I want to leave those entries unedited as they represent an idea or behaviour I wanted to express at that time.

My intent writing down my ideas are to have them more clear, and maybe get others perspective as response to what I write.

Have a good reading.
