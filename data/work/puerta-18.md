[Puerta 18](http://www.puerta18.org.ar/) is kind of a hacker space for people between 13 and 24 years old. In there they give different courses and workshops.

Taught the **JavaScript** part of a coursed called "Introduction to Programming". In that course there was also another teacher that gave the UX, HTML and CSS part.

From 2019/06/18 to 2019/06/25.

I gave only 3 classes. Similar to what I did on Comunidad IT at the beginning.
