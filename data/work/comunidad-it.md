From: 2018/07/10 to 2019/04/17.

At first, I taught the **JavaScript** content part of a course called "Introduction to Programming". Then I start helping and giving the **HTML** and **CSS** part too. Also collaborating in creating study material and exercises, always available for questions and helping the students understand the fundamentals of programming.

Don't remember the amount of courses I gave, but somewhat like 10 I think.
