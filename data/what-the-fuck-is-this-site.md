# What the fuck is this site?

Simple site that I've built to upload content. With some exceptions, more useful for me than others.

I could have used a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), but wanted to learn doing one by myself (kind off, still used some high level tools).

To navigate thought the site, I recommend using [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

## Design philosophy

There isn't one. I just wanted to worry less about design decisions.

I even copied the css for [this guy](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/), and the table styles from GitHub markdown pages. This is the [only css I use](/styles.css).

Although the design is very simple, I'll make some [improvements](/site-improvements) to the site, but the main "philosophy" will maintain the same.
