# What the fuck is this site?
Simple site that I've built to upload content. In general most useful for me than for others.

I could have used a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), but wanted to learn stuff while doing this.

Although the design is very simple, I'll make some [improvements](./improvements) to the site, the idea will maintain the same.

To navigate thought the site, I recommend using [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).
