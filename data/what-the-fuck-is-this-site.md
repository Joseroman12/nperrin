Simple site that I've built to upload content. With some exceptions, more useful for me than others.

I could have used a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), but wanted to learn by doing something different, with some tools that I wanted to try. In specific I used shell scripts with shellcheck, and pandoc.

The code of the site is here: [nperrin github repository](https://github.com/normanperrin/nperrin). But as the code is not minified, you could download or inspect the code with dev tools. Feel free to copy and use as you want everything on this site.

Also, I have a [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) if interested on reading it.
