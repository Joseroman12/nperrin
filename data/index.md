This is a simple site that I've built to upload content. With some exceptions, more useful for me than others.

I could have used a static site generator like [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), but wanted to do something different and try some new tools. In specific I used shell scripts with shellcheck, and pandoc.

The code itself is here: [nperrin github repository](https://github.com/NormanPerrin/nperrin/tree/src). But you can also just look at the source code, as it's readable.

Also, I have a [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) if interested on reading it.
