## Add

- Atom feed.
- GraphQL client.
- Subdomains for:
  - Habits tracking.
  - Whatever I feel like adding.
- Pre-commit dictionary validations.
- Separate guides and add PDF download link.
- webmentions.
- h-entry.
- Instagram replica with microformats.

## Better

- Deploy on own server.
- Thumbnail images sizes... would be good to be able to automatically generate well sized images.
- Update listing on index files.

    - show time of creation or modification.
    - if modification, show git diff on description.
- Separate guides on another domain.
    - Add next and previous buttons.
    - Add progress bar.
