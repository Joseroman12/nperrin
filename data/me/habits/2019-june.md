# June

Based on the [basic rules](/me/habits/rules#habits).

This will be the first month of this attempt to have better habits, so I'll let myself 2 days a week to break this habits.

## Following

### Week #1

|     | Eating | Exercise | Sleep | Communication | Social networks | Internet | Other |
| --- | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| SAT | 0      |   0      |   0   |  0            | 0               | 0        | 0     |

#### SAT

Wasn't expecting to follow the habits a Saturday when arriving from Cordoba.

Only thing that broke the **eating** habit was 2 pieces of bread.

Then I had a lot to do, so didn't **exercise** or do the **other** activities.

Didn't follow the **sleep** part as I went to bed late for going out.

Finally I forgot about what habits had to follow for **communications**, **social networks** and **internet**.

I didn't think I did bad, as I eat pretty well and had a productive day overall.

#### SUN

**Eat** a pizza with my dad... didn't want to take care when weekend.

Then didn't **exercise** as I got interested in other stuff, but could have been nice going for a run.

On **social networks** I didn't realize that I checked more than twice twitter.

Then for **others** I didn't meditate, but read.

#### MON

**Eat** a day menu and came with dessert and coffee, could have refused but didn't.

For **exercise** I should have planned better the day before, as I end work and didn't have the clothe for going, also it was late, as I had to start at 9 for being the first day at the co-working space.

For **communications** I coundn't avoid to check my mail more that twice... maybe 5 times.

For **internet** I checked twitter more than two times, althought I didn't put time to it, just opened the window to see if I got any notifications, then close it... but didn't follow the rules.

#### TUE

Didn't **exercise** as was tired for work and wanted to finish something. Dind't sleep the hours I wanted because I woke up early, but wouldn't put that as a failure of my **sleeping** habit as there were not much I can do about getting up early and not being able to sleep after.

#### WED

Didn't **exercise**, **read** nor **medidate** today, blame on lack of planning.

On the exercise part I was having trouble deciding if on morning or after work, will do it on morning. Also meditate would be better to do it before work. I could read 30' before and if I want 30' after.

#### TUE

So today I wanted to rest in between work... I have a coffee shop near my office, went there and **eat** a pudding with a coffee. Also when arriving home, I didn't want to cook because it was late so end up eating what my family prepared that had some wheat flour, not a lot but anyways.

Also mention that I had to check whatsapp and end up seeing an important message I had to reply. That reply end up being a back and forward... so at that point the **communication** habit was broke.

Then I checked my **social networks** more than twice as I was bored at worked. Should have read something instead or chat.

#### FRI

Awesome morning but after lunch I wanted to go read so time before comming back to work, so went to a near caffee again, breaking my **eat** rule for having a coffee after lunch and for having something sweet to eat with with the coffee. Then I went out that night and eat more junk with a lot of beer... which is fine, I don't want to look like that guy that only drinks water and keeps a log of their habits, but should have take more care within the week, it's ok for me to have a beer when going out or not being not to strict on weekends.

#### SAT

Didn't want to follow the habit rules, as I mentioned on the basic rules definition.

In retrospective, I should have take more care on the week, and not go so bad on the weekend.

#### Thoughts on the week

Didn't follow the rules well, realized that I have to plan carefully the next day, and that I have to have replacements, so maybe buy some unsweet chocolate or have some fruit.

Then I realized that some rules are not so well written, or that I'm not so specific. So I'll clarify some.

#### MON

Pretty good day. Just that I **eat** a cookie, just one, and it even was selled like "healthy"... but ok, rule broke.

Then as I sleep more time than usual, so I didn't **read**.

#### TUE

Don't want to **eat** well really haha. **Eat** a pudin and a cookie today. Is not very bad but still.

I have to make a replacement for when I want something sweet or with chocolate, like a fruit or 80% chocolate.
