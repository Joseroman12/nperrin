# June

Based on the [basic rules](/me/habits/rules#habits).

This will be the first month of this attempt to have better habits, so I'll let myself 2 days a week to break this habits.

## Following

### Week #1

|     | Eating | Exercise | Sleep | Communication | Social networks | Internet | Other |
| --- | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| SAT | 0      |   0      |   0   |  0            | 0               | 0        | 0     |

#### SAT

Wasn't expecting to follow the habits a Saturday when arriving from Cordoba.

Only thing that broke the **eating** habit was 2 pieces of bread.

Then I had a lot to do, so didn't **exercise** or do the **other** activities.

Didn't follow the **sleep** part as I went to bed late for going out.

Finally I forgot about what habits had to follow for **communications**, **social networks** and **internet**.

I didn't think I did bad, as I eat pretty well and had a productive day overall.

### SUN

**Eat** a pizza with my dad... didn't want to take care when weekend.

Then didn't **exercise** as I got interested in other stuff, but could have been nice going for a run.

On **social networks** I didn't realize that I checked more than twice twitter.

Then for **others** I didn't meditate, but read.

### MON

**Eat** a day menu and came with dessert and coffee, could have refused but didn't.

For **exercise** I should have planned better the day before, as I end work and didn't have the clothe for going, also it was late, as I had to start at 9 for being the first day at the co-working space.

For **communications** I coundn't avoid to check my mail more that twice... maybe 5 times.

For **internet** I checked twitter more than two times, althought I didn't put time to it, just opened the window to see if I got any notifications, then close it... but didn't follow the rules.
